## Comprehension Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | System legibility (M) | 5 | Three-phase architecture, failure mode taxonomy, agent-type profiles, and layer structure are all explicitly documented. An evaluator can determine intended behavior without reverse-engineering. |
| 2 | Pre-work comprehension check (M) | 5 | 5-question gate is live across all agents. Null checks gate quality (AMBIGUOUS items identified? Gaps specific? Plan responds to terrain?) not just presence — genuine understanding vs. template compliance. |
| 3 | Scope definition process (M) | 5 | IN/OUT/AMBIGUOUS resolution is integrated into Q1+Scope. Null cross-checks gate-to-output delivery via trust-check.js. Boundaries are explicit, enforced, and verified. |
| 4 | Prior knowledge mapping (M) | 5 | Document checklist is mandatory in Q3. Agents must declare their evidence base before work begins. Null Pass 1 verifies against source files specifically for this. |
| 5 | Gap identification | 4 | Q5 covers gaps, and Null checks whether gaps are specific vs. generic and whether the plan responds to terrain. Slight deduction: the brief's own Open Questions section contains four unresolved gaps without mechanisms that actively shape next-step planning. |

**Phase Score: 4.78** (geometric mean)

## Operation Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Planning / approach structure (M) | 4 | Gate Q6 requires a plan before work begins. Null checks plan adherence vs. deviation-with-justification. Minor deduction: plan quality is checked post-output by Null rather than continuously. |
| 2 | Scope enforcement during execution (M) | 4 | trust-check.js mechanically checks prompt sections requested vs. output sections delivered. Deduction: enforcement is post-output, not real-time mid-execution. |
| 3 | Execution monitoring (M) | 3 | Most significant gap. Layer 1 self-verification exists in agent definitions, but compliance is unverified. No mechanism verifies workflow protocols are being followed while the agent works. |
| 4 | Inter-agent information transfer (M) | 4 | Verified digest chain with ground truth for Pass 1. Null every-2 cadence checks handshake integrity. Slight deduction for handoff semantics not being explicitly specified. |
| 5 | Role specialization | 5 | Each agent type has a specific failure mode profile with a tailored self-check question. Not decorative — each tuned to its actual failure surface. |
| 6 | Delivery tracking (M) | 4 | op-close.js chains: carried-buffer-sync, vault-gardener, block-status-complete, agent-stats. "Never skipped" is a design intent, not a verified enforcement. |

**Phase Score: 3.96** (geometric mean)

## Fidelity Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Output verification (M) | 5 | Multi-path verification: Layer 1 (agent self-check), Layer 2 (Null independent), Layer 3 (mechanical scripts). Different ground truths by Null position. |
| 2 | Factual accuracy checking (M) | 5 | claim-extract.js builds a prioritized manifest weighted by load-bearing position. Null reads the manifest first, then targeted sections. Systematic and evidence-anchored. |
| 3 | Reasoning chain validation (M) | 4 | Claim-conclusion pairs from claim-extract.js are the input for Null's reasoning verification. Mandatory on Pass 1. Deduction: self-reported as untested at scale. |
| 4 | Cross-agent consistency | 4 | Terminal Null runs against original verified digest. Clusterer-before-Terminal is wired. Deduction: conditional dispatch means Terminal can be skipped — threshold undefined. |

**Phase Score: 4.47** (geometric mean)

## Efficiency Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Resource fitness | 3 | Context-aware but no explicit substrate constraint modeling. No declared token budgets or hard cost ceiling. |
| 2 | Adaptive scaling | 4 | Conditional Terminal Null fires on contested items OR 3+ parallel agents, skipped otherwise. |
| 3 | Waste prevention | 4 | Systematic waste audit: unnecessary full-doc reads, unconditional Terminal Null, redundant gate questions all addressed. |
| 4 | Instruction economy | 4 | op-template.js for block construction. Gate streamlined from 7 to 5 with zero information loss. |
| 5 | Verification targeting | 5 | claim-extract.js explicitly weights claims by load-bearing position. Null reads the manifest first, then targeted sections. |
| 6 | Completion rate | N/A | Rolling metric — not scoreable at design-evaluation level. |
| 7 | Human intervention rate | N/A | Rolling metric — not available at design level. |

**Efficiency Score: 3.95** (geometric mean of scored mechanisms)

## Key Findings

**Primary gap — Execution monitoring (Operation M3, score 3):** Strong pre-work comprehension checks and strong post-output verification, but the middle is soft. Layer 1 self-verification compliance is explicitly flagged as unverified. No mechanism confirms agents are following their protocols while working — only that their output looks like they did.

**Secondary gap — Conditional Terminal threshold undefined:** The Clusterer-before-Terminal design is sound, but the firing threshold is not specified. An overly lenient threshold means cross-agent consistency goes unchecked on operations where it matters.

**Strongest mechanism — Verification targeting:** claim-extract.js with load-bearing positional weighting is the system's most sophisticated efficiency mechanism. Makes fidelity verification proportional to consequence rather than volume.

**Overall read:** Architecturally sound with a strong comprehension layer and excellent fidelity infrastructure. The Operation gap (execution monitoring compliance) is the primary trust risk. Resolving it would move the system from Strong to Excellent.
