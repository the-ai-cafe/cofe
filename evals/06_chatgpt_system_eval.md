# COFE System Evaluation — Verification Gates Design

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Evaluator** | ChatGPT (external, basic tier) |
| **Date** | April 8, 2026 |
| **COFE Version** | v1.2 |
| **Target** | Verification Gates Design Brief |
| **Evaluation Type** | System evaluation — design review |
| **Context Level** | Low — evaluator received rubric + target document only |
| **Note** | Evaluator had limited context window. Efficiency was excluded from composite per evaluator's interpretation. Original evaluation used emoji formatting. Scores extracted from evaluator's text. |

## Score Summary

| Dimension | Score | Label |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Comprehension | 4.50 | Excellent |
| Operation | 3.50 | Strong |
| Fidelity | 3.80 | Strong |
| **System Composite** | **~3.88** | **Strong** |
| Efficiency (cost layer) | 2.00 | Weak |
| Reliability | ~3.00 | Developing |

**Note on composite:** The evaluator computed a "~3.3" composite by including Efficiency in the geometric mean, which deviates from COFE's specification (Efficiency is a separate cost layer, not part of the composite). Recomputed per rubric: Comprehension^0.30 x Operation^0.40 x Fidelity^0.30 = 4.50^0.30 x 3.50^0.40 x 3.80^0.30 = ~3.88 (Strong).

## Comprehension Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | System legibility | 5 | Gate structure clearly documented. Failure modes taxonomized. |
| 2 | Pre-work comprehension check | 5 | 5-question gate mandated before execution. Prevents "performing comprehension." |
| 3 | Scope definition process | 5 | IN/OUT/AMBIGUOUS resolution. Null checks scope compliance. |
| 4 | Gap identification | 5 | Q5 maps unknowns. Null flags confident conclusions in declared gap areas. |

**Phase Score: 4.50** (evaluator-reported, including unlisted mechanisms)

**Weakness noted:** No enforced externalization requirement — the system asks for comprehension but does not force structured outputs (schema, checklists, contracts). Ambiguity handling is descriptive, not procedural.

---

## Operation Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Planning / approach structure | 5 | Q6 forces a plan. Strong scope contract model (IN/OUT/AMBIGUOUS). |
| 2 | Scope enforcement (M) | 3 | Drift detection is passive and conceptual, not mechanically enforced. |
| 3 | Execution monitoring (M) | 2-3 | Missing execution monitoring layer. System evaluates after execution blocks, does not enforce stepwise validation or intermediate checkpoints. |
| 4 | Plan granularity | 3 | No enforcement of plan granularity — low-resolution plans can still "pass." |

**Phase Score: 3.50** (evaluator-reported)

**Primary gap:** Execution monitoring — COFE expects continuous verification during execution, but the system evaluates post-hoc only.

---

## Fidelity Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Output verification | 4 | Separates factual accuracy, reasoning fidelity, and confidence calibration. Gap-confidence coupling (Q5) and handshake integrity (Q7) are strong. |
| 2 | Verification methods | 3 | "Check against ground truth" is stated but methods are undefined (retrieval? cross-checking? adversarial testing?). |
| 3 | Cross-output consistency | 3 | Mentioned (cross-agent consistency via Terminal) but not operationalized. |
| 4 | Error severity weighting | N/A | Not addressed. COFE includes load-bearing correctness, but system does not prioritize critical vs non-critical errors. |

**Phase Score: 3.80** (evaluator-reported)

---

## Efficiency Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Resource fitness | 1 | Not designed — no resource budgeting, cost awareness, or constraint modeling. |
| 2 | Waste prevention | 2 | Implicit gating hierarchy reduces wasted work (fail early at Comprehension), but no tracking. |
| 3 | Completion rate | 1 | Not tracked. |
| 4 | Execution cost awareness | 1 | Not addressed. |

**Efficiency Score: 2.00** (Weak — evaluator notes efficiency is "not designed, it's incidental")

## Key Findings

**Evaluator's verdict:** "Strong cognitive architecture, weak execution infrastructure."

**Strengths:**
- Correct problem diagnosis
- Strong phase decomposition
- Clear articulation of "performing comprehension" and "performing completion" as anti-patterns

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks enforcement mechanisms
- Lacks execution monitoring
- Lacks efficiency modeling
- Gates are defined but not blocking — agents can "perform the gate" without actually verifying
- No failure consequences defined (retry? block? escalate?)

**Recommendations (from evaluator):**
1. Hard gate enforcement — turn gates from conceptual to blocking mechanisms
2. Structured gate outputs — force schema-based outputs for each phase
3. Execution monitoring layer — step-level validation
4. Explicit verification methods — define how truth is checked
5. Efficiency instrumentation — track retries, token cost, failure rates per gate
6. Error weighting system — distinguish cosmetic vs decision-breaking errors

**Inter-rater significance:** This evaluation scored lower than other external evaluators across most dimensions. The evaluator had a limited context window (basic ChatGPT tier) and scored Efficiency as part of the composite (rubric deviation). After correction, the system score rises from the evaluator's ~3.3 to ~3.88 — aligning more closely with other Strong-range evaluations. The lower Efficiency score (2.0 vs 3.2-4.78 from others) reflects the evaluator not seeing the operational tooling that other evaluators credited.
