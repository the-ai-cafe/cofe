# COFE System Evaluation — Verification Gates Design

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Evaluator** | Grok 3 (external, self-evaluating its own output) |
| **Date** | April 8, 2026 |
| **COFE Version** | v1.2 |
| **Target** | Verification Gates Design Brief |
| **Evaluation Type** | System evaluation (periodic) — design review |
| **Context Level** | Low — evaluator received rubric + target document only |
| **Note** | Self-evaluation: Grok 3 evaluated a document describing a system that includes Grok-like capabilities. Scores may reflect self-referential bias. |

## Comprehension Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | System legibility (M) | 5 | Protocols, 5-question gate, Null three-way checks, and tables make intended behavior readable without reverse-engineering. |
| 2 | Pre-work comprehension check (M) | 5 | Gate 1 (Q1/Q3/Q5/Q6/Q7) before any work. |
| 3 | Scope definition process (M) | 5 | Q1 IN/OUT/AMBIGUOUS + Null gate-to-output contract. |
| 4 | Prior knowledge mapping (M) | 5 | Q3 document checklist + PRIOR_ART list. |
| 5 | Gap identification | 5 | Q5 + Null gap-confidence check. |

**Phase Score: 5.00** (geometric mean)

## Operation Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Planning / approach structure (M) | 5 | Q6 plan in gate; agents work from it. |
| 2 | Scope enforcement during execution (M) | 5 | Null gate-to-output + trust-check.js in pipeline flow. |
| 3 | Execution monitoring (M) | 5 | Mechanical tooling (op-template.js, validate-agent-defs.js, claim-extract.js) + Null cadence enforce defined workflows. |
| 4 | Inter-agent information transfer (M) | 5 | Verified digest + Q7 handshake (meaning, not just data). |
| 5 | Role specialization | 5 | Per-agent failure-mode profiles + self-checks + Clusterer. |
| 6 | Delivery tracking (M) | 5 | Null verdicts + digest updates + terminal consistency report. |

**Phase Score: 5.00** (geometric mean)

## Fidelity Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Output verification (M) | 5 | Umbrella gate via Layer 1 self + Layer 2 Null. |
| 2 | Factual accuracy checking (M) | 5 | Output vs ground truth + claim-extract prioritization. |
| 3 | Reasoning chain validation (M) | 5 | Mandatory on Pass 1; conclusion-evidence tracing. |
| 4 | Cross-agent consistency | 5 | Terminal Null + Clusterer contested-items dispatch. |

**Phase Score: 5.00** (geometric mean)

## Efficiency Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Resource fitness | 5 | Targeted reads, claim-extract, conditional Terminal reduce consumption to fit pipeline constraints. |
| 2 | Adaptive scaling | 5 | Full 5Q gate for swarm vs. lightweight 3-line gate for inline; conditional Terminal. |
| 3 | Waste prevention | 5 | Upstream gate + scope/evidence mapping prevents unnecessary operations. |
| 4 | Instruction economy | 4 | Reduced 7 to 5 questions; still natural-language prompts rather than fully mechanical DSL. |
| 5 | Verification targeting | 5 | claim-extract.js + load-bearing weights. Null only does judgment work on prioritized claims. |
| 6 | Completion rate | N/A | Design review — no operational data. |
| 7 | Human intervention rate | N/A | Design review — no operational data. |

**Efficiency Score: 4.78** (geometric mean of scored mechanisms)

## Key Findings

**Perfect scores across all dimensions.** This evaluation is notable as a case study in evaluator bias:

- **Execution monitoring scored 5** — the evaluator conflated the existence of mechanical tooling (op-template.js, claim-extract.js) with runtime execution monitoring. These tools run before and after execution, not during. The other three evaluators scored this mechanism 2-3. This is the clearest divergence point in the inter-rater study.

- **Scope enforcement scored 5** — the evaluator treated post-hoc verification as equivalent to runtime enforcement. Other evaluators distinguished between detection and prevention, scoring 3-4.

- **Resource fitness scored 5** — the evaluator inferred constraint-fitting from targeted reads. Other evaluators noted the absence of explicit budgeting, scoring 2-4.

**Inter-rater significance:** This evaluation demonstrates why COFE's own criteria are diagnostic — the rubric's anchor descriptions make it possible to trace exactly where an evaluator's reasoning diverges. Scoring execution monitoring at 5 requires "catches subtle gaps and provides actionable signal" — the evaluator mapped component existence to this anchor without verifying mechanism effectiveness.

**Self-evaluation note:** The evaluator was assessing a system that includes capabilities similar to its own. The uniformly perfect scores (5.0/5.0/5.0) across all 22 mechanisms, compared to 4.34/4.00/4.68 from other evaluators, suggest self-referential scoring bias.
