## Comprehension Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | System legibility (M) | 5 | Exceptionally legible. Clear structure (problem, phases, gates, null, layers, implementation status). Terminology defined. Failure modes taxonomized. |
| 2 | Pre-work comprehension check (M) | 5 | Mandates a 5-question comprehension gate before any work begins. Defines failure mode "performing comprehension" and how the gate prevents it. |
| 3 | Scope definition process (M) | 5 | Q1 explicitly requires IN/OUT/AMBIGUOUS. Null verification checks gate scope against output. Scope drift is a named failure mode. |
| 4 | Prior knowledge mapping (M) | 5 | Q3 asks "What already exists?" plus document checklist. Prior art mapping is required. Null checks that prior art was referenced, not reinvented. |
| 5 | Gap identification | 5 | Q5 asks "What don't I know?" Gaps are mapped. Null flags confident conclusions in declared gap areas. Ties gap awareness to confidence calibration. |

**Phase Score: 5.00** (geometric mean)

## Operation Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Planning / approach structure (M) | 5 | Q6 requires a plan. Null checks plan adherence or justified deviation. Includes plan steps in the gate and verification. |
| 2 | Scope enforcement during execution (M) | 4 | Null's gate-scope-to-output check catches scope drift post-execution. Does not describe runtime enforcement — relies on detection after the fact. |
| 3 | Execution monitoring (M) | 3 | No mechanism to verify that the defined workflow is followed during execution. Assumes compliance. Null checks output but not process adherence. Adequate but passive. |
| 4 | Inter-agent information transfer (M) | 5 | Q7 handshake, Null check #1 (Q7 vs verified digest) and #2 (Q7 vs agent output). Verified digest propagates downstream. Robust. |
| 5 | Role specialization | 4 | Agent-type specific self-checks and Clusterer for contested items. Does not quantify "impactful uniques" or provide metrics for convergent validation. |
| 6 | Delivery tracking (M) | 5 | Null's gate-to-output check verifies all committed deliverables (IN scope items) are present. Also mentions op-close.js and block-status-complete. Complete. |

**Phase Score: 4.26** (geometric mean)

## Fidelity Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Output verification (M) | 5 | Full Null verification layer (independent, adversarial, three-way check). Operates at every-2-agent cadence. Mechanical tooling supports it. |
| 2 | Factual accuracy checking (M) | 5 | Null's output-to-ground-truth comparison. claim-extract.js prioritises load-bearing claims. Reasoning check also catches factual leaps. |
| 3 | Reasoning chain validation (M) | 5 | Mandatory on Pass 1. claim-extract extracts claim-conclusion pairs. Null checks whether conclusions follow from cited evidence. Per-conclusion verdicts specified. |
| 4 | Cross-agent consistency | 5 | Terminal Null runs when Clusterer identifies contested items. Produces per-agent verdicts and cross-agent consistency report. Explicitly designed. |

**Phase Score: 5.00** (geometric mean)

## Efficiency Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Resource fitness | 4 | Targeted reads, claim-extract, conditional Terminal reduce consumption. No explicit budgeting stated, but likely fits constraints. |
| 2 | Adaptive scaling | 5 | Conditional Terminal Null (skip when not needed). Full 5Q gate for swarm vs lightweight for inline. |
| 3 | Waste prevention | 5 | Upstream gate + scope/evidence mapping prevents unnecessary reads/writes/tool calls. Streamlining section maps wastes to preventers. |
| 4 | Instruction economy | 5 | Reduced 7 to 5 questions with zero information loss. Each question has a distinct job. |
| 5 | Verification targeting | 5 | claim-extract.js + load-bearing weights. Null only does judgment work on prioritized claims. |
| 6 | Completion rate | N/A | Design review — no operational data. |
| 7 | Human intervention rate | N/A | Design review — no operational data. |

**Efficiency Score: 4.78** (geometric mean of scored mechanisms)

## Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- Complete comprehension gate with explicit anti-pattern detection ("performing comprehension")
- Rigorous Null verification with three-way checks and mechanical tooling
- Excellent fidelity mechanisms across all four sub-dimensions
- Adaptive efficiency with conditional dispatch and targeted verification

**Weaknesses:**
- Execution monitoring is passive — assumes compliance, no runtime checks
- Scope enforcement is post-hoc, not proactive
- Role specialization metrics not quantified

**Comparison to external system (kernel evaluation):**

| Dimension | External System | Verification Gates Design |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Comprehension | 2.93 (Developing) | 5.00 (Excellent) |
| Operation | 2.63 (Developing) | 4.26 (Strong) |
| Fidelity | 2.00 (Weak) | 5.00 (Excellent) |
| System Score | 2.50 (Developing) | 4.68 (Excellent) |

**Overall:** The design is Excellent under COFE. The gap between design and implementation is the identified risk — the running system should match this specification.
