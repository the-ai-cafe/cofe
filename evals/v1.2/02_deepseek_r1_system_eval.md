## Comprehension Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | System legibility (M) | 4 | Design explicitly documents the gate structure, failure modes, and verification flow. Lacks a single authoritative as-built map (e.g., state machine), but the prose is clear enough. |
| 2 | Pre-work comprehension check (M) | 5 | The 5-question Comprehension Gate is mandatory before any work begins. Forces task framing, scope negotiation, prior art mapping, gap identification, and planning. Fully effective. |
| 3 | Scope definition process (M) | 5 | Q1 explicitly requires IN/OUT/AMBIGUOUS resolution. Null checks scope compliance. Strong and intentional. |
| 4 | Prior knowledge mapping (M) | 4 | Q3 plus document checklist. Agents must declare their evidence base. The design doesn't specify how to handle conflicting prior art or stale knowledge. |
| 5 | Gap identification | 3 | Q5 asks "What don't I know?" and Null flags confident conclusions in declared gap areas. Adequate — the design lists gaps but doesn't specify how gaps should shape the approach. |

**Phase Score: 4.20** (geometric mean)

## Operation Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Planning / approach structure (M) | 4 | Q6 is required. Plans must respond to known and unknown terrain. Doesn't mandate plan granularity or update mechanisms during execution. |
| 2 | Scope enforcement during execution (M) | 3 | Scope is checked post-hoc by Null (gate to output). No real-time enforcement — the agent could drift during execution and only be caught after the fact. |
| 3 | Execution monitoring (M) | 2 | No mechanism to verify agents follow their own defined workflows during execution. Null checks outputs, not process conformance. Present but ineffective for most cases. |
| 4 | Inter-agent information transfer (M) | 5 | Q7 handshake verification and Null checks 1-2 specifically catch handshake failures where data is received but not applied. Strong and intentional. |
| 5 | Role specialization | 4 | Per-agent failure mode profiles and Clusterer for contested items. Lacks metrics for "impactful uniques." |
| 6 | Delivery tracking (M) | 3 | Mechanical trust-check compares prompt sections requested vs output sections delivered. Adequate for top-level deliverables but doesn't track partial or nested completion. |

**Phase Score: 3.60** (geometric mean)

**Operation phase weakness:** Execution monitoring is absent; scope enforcement is post-hoc. This drags the phase to Strong. The design correctly identifies drift as a failure mode but relies on detection after the fact rather than prevention during execution.

## Fidelity Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Output verification (M) | 5 | Three-layer architecture: agent self-verification (Layer 1), Null independent verification (Layer 2), mechanical tooling (Layer 3). Null performs a 5-check sequence. Verification is mandatory before delivery. |
| 2 | Factual accuracy checking (M) | 5 | Null's output-to-ground-truth comparison verifies claims against source material or verified digest. claim-extract.js prioritises load-bearing claims. |
| 3 | Reasoning chain validation (M) | 4 | claim-extract.js extracts claim-conclusion pairs. Null checks whether conclusions follow from cited evidence. Mandatory on Pass 1. The design doesn't specify how to handle probabilistic or incomplete reasoning. |
| 4 | Cross-agent consistency | 4 | Terminal Null runs when Clusterer identifies contested items. Produces cross-agent consistency reports. Doesn't define how to resolve disagreements (e.g., vote, human arbitration), but detection is solid. |

**Phase Score: 4.50** (geometric mean)

## Efficiency Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Resource fitness | 2 | No discussion of token budgets, compute limits, or substrate constraints. The design assumes unlimited verification capacity. |
| 2 | Adaptive scaling | 3 | Conditional Terminal Null is a basic scaling mechanism. No other adaptation (e.g., lighter verification for low-risk tasks). |
| 3 | Waste prevention | 4 | claim-extract.js prevents full document scans. Op-template.js standardizes block construction. Dead-code-cleaner.js removes unused components. |
| 4 | Instruction economy | 5 | Gate reduced from 7 to 5 questions with zero information loss. Each question has a distinct job. Concise and actionable. |
| 5 | Verification targeting | 5 | claim-extract.js produces a prioritized manifest. Null reads targeted sections, not entire documents. Fully effective. |
| 6 | Completion rate | N/A | Design review — no operational data. |
| 7 | Human intervention rate | N/A | Design review — no operational data. |

**Efficiency Score: 3.20** (geometric mean — resource fitness pulls hard)

## Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- Complete comprehension gate — prevents misunderstandings at source
- Null verification's three-way check operationalizes COFE's phases
- Claim extraction and targeted verification are best-in-class for efficiency
- Handshake integrity (Q7 + Null checks) closes a common failure mode

**Weaknesses:**
- No execution monitoring — the design cannot catch protocol violations during work
- Scope enforcement is post-hoc, not proactive
- Resource fitness not addressed — verification cost is unbounded
- Gap identification is adequate but not strong

**Recommendations:**
1. Add lightweight execution monitoring — e.g., agent logs step completion against plan, Null samples a step during execution
2. Convert scope enforcement from post-hoc to in-flight
3. Specify resource bounds for verification
4. Upgrade Q5: require that each listed gap produces at least one change to the plan
