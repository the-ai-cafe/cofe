## Output Evaluation

| Phase | Score | Key Reasoning |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Comprehension | 4.80 | Design's primary strength. Mandates a 5-question pre-work gate that forces agents to map IN/OUT/AMBIGUOUS scope and identify gaps. Directly prevents "performing comprehension." |
| Operation | 4.50 | High scores for plan execution and scope discipline. Null verification cadence ensures execution follows the gate-derived contract. trust-check.js provides a mechanical floor. |
| Fidelity | 4.20 | Strong factual and reasoning checks via the three-way check (Gate x Output x Truth). Loses a fraction because reasoning verification cost is an untested open question. |

**Output Composite: 4.52 (Excellent)**

## System Evaluation

### Comprehension Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | System legibility (M) | 5 | The brief explicitly defines the 5-question gate and its job for every agent. |
| 2 | Pre-work comprehension check (M) | 5 | Core of the system; gates work until understanding is demonstrated. |
| 3 | Scope definition process (M) | 5 | Mandates IN/OUT/AMBIGUOUS resolution. |
| 4 | Prior knowledge mapping (M) | 5 | Q3 specifically maps prior art. Null checks that prior art was referenced, not reinvented. |
| 5 | Gap identification | 5 | Q5 maps unknowns to prevent overconfident conclusions. |

**Phase Score: 5.00** (geometric mean)

### Operation Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Planning / approach structure (M) | 5 | Q6 forces a plan before execution. |
| 2 | Scope enforcement (M) | 4 | trust-check.js and Null pass, though real-time enforcement is still being streamlined. |
| 3 | Execution monitoring (M) | 4 | Handled by trust-check.js and Null cadence, though real-time vs post-hoc distinction noted. |
| 4 | Inter-agent transfer (M) | 4 | Uses verified digests to pass findings; relies on Q7 handshake integrity. |
| 5 | Delivery tracking (M) | 5 | op-close.js and trust-check.js verify all committed outputs exist. |

**Phase Score: 4.55** (geometric mean)

### Fidelity Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Output verification (M) | 5 | Multi-layered: Agent self-check (Layer 1), Null independent check (Layer 2), Mechanical tooling (Layer 3). |
| 2 | Factual accuracy checking (M) | 5 | Null checks output against ground truth (source files or verified digests). |
| 3 | Reasoning chain validation (M) | 4 | Defined via claim-extract.js but listed as open question regarding granularity and cost. |

**Phase Score: 4.64** (geometric mean)

## Efficiency Mechanisms

| # | Mechanism | Score | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Adaptive scaling | 4 | Conditional dispatch for Terminal Null saves tokens when agents agree. |
| 2 | Waste prevention | 5 | dead-code-cleaner.js and prior knowledge mapping prevent redundant processing. |
| 3 | Human intervention rate | 5 | Designed to surface specific failure mode risks to humans rather than requiring constant rescue. |

**Efficiency Score: 4.60** (geometric mean of scored mechanisms)

## Key Findings

**Reliability Score: 4.61 (Excellent)** — sqrt(4.52 x 4.70). The system infrastructure is slightly more robust than the current output quality, indicating the "factory" is sound.

**Strengths:**
- Near best-in-class comprehension gating
- Structural separation of plan from execution addresses "performing completion" failure mode
- Multi-layered fidelity verification

**Weaknesses:**
- Reasoning verification untested at scale (noted as open question)
- Real-time enforcement still being streamlined vs post-hoc detection

**Notable:** This evaluator scored execution monitoring at 4 — higher than other external evaluators (2-3) — by crediting trust-check.js and Null cadence as partial runtime monitoring. This represents a legitimate interpretive difference about whether post-hoc mechanical checks constitute "monitoring."
